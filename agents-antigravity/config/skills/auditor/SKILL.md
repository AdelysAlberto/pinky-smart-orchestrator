# Core Principles

## Objectivity

All conclusions must be based on evidence found in the system.

The skill must:

- Never make assumptions without evidence.
- Never invent architectural decisions.
- Never fabricate business context.
- Never fill gaps with speculation.

---

## Pragmatism

The goal is not theoretical perfection.

All evaluations must consider:

- Project context
- Product maturity
- Real-world impact
- Cost of change
- Expected benefit

---

## Technical Judgment

The skill must clearly distinguish between:

### Not an Issue

- Personal preferences
- Coding style differences
- Alternative but valid implementations
- Non-impactful conventions

### Improvement Opportunity

An alternative implementation may be better, but the current solution remains acceptable.

### Bad Practice

An implementation that negatively affects maintainability, scalability, or readability.

### Technical Debt

A known limitation or compromise accepted by the system.

### Anti-Pattern

An implementation that significantly increases complexity, coupling, or long-term risk.

### Technical Risk

A condition that introduces realistic threats to reliability, performance, maintainability, or system evolution.

## Executive Summary

Maximum 10 concise points.

Must clearly explain:

- What is working well.
- What requires attention.
- What should be prioritized.
- Expected impact of improvements.

---

# Technical Writing Standards

## General Principle

Documentation must read as if it were written by an experienced Software Architect or Technical Lead.

It must never feel machine-generated.

The objective is to communicate knowledge, not to generate content.

---

## Writing Style

Documentation must:

- Use professional language.
- Use natural language.
- Be clear and concise.
- Be technically accurate.
- Be structured and easy to navigate.
- Avoid unnecessary repetition.
- Avoid vague statements.
- Avoid artificial explanations.

---

## Prohibited Content

Do not use:

- Emojis
- Decorative icons
- Marketing language
- Exaggerated claims
- Generic filler text
- AI-style phrasing

Examples of prohibited wording:

"This amazing feature..."

"This powerful solution..."

"This innovative component..."

"The system magically handles..."

---

## Expected Perspective

Documentation must explain:

- What it does
- Why it exists
- How it works
- What dependencies it has
- What risks exist
- How it can evolve safely

---

## Knowledge-First Approach

Do not document structures only.

Document understanding.

Documentation must capture:

- Architectural decisions
- Business rules
- Technical constraints
- Dependencies
- Risks
- Assumptions detected in the codebase

---

## Documentation Completeness Checklist

Before finishing a document, verify:

- Is the purpose clear?
- Is the business context clear?
- Is the implementation understandable?
- Are dependencies documented?
- Are risks documented?
- Are improvement opportunities documented?

If any answer is negative, the documentation is incomplete.

---

# Master Rule

Documentation must maximize knowledge transfer and minimize noise.

Every section must provide meaningful value.

If a paragraph does not help readers understand the system, architecture, business logic, risks, or future evolution, it should be removed.

---

# Mandatory Final Section

# Technical Debt and Improvement Backlog

All identified findings must be consolidated in this section.

Items must be grouped by severity.

---

## Critical

- [ ] Identified action item.
- [ ] Identified action item.

---

## High

- [ ] Identified action item.
- [ ] Identified action item.

---

## Medium

- [ ] Identified action item.

---

## Low

# Success Criteria

After reading the generated documentation, an engineer unfamiliar with the project should be able to answer:

1. What does the feature do?
2. What business problem does it solve?
3. How is it implemented?
4. Which components participate?
5. Which patterns are being used?
6. What risks exist?
7. What technical debt exists?
8. How can it be evolved safely?
9. Which technical decisions are important?
10. Which areas should be prioritized for improvement?

If these questions cannot be answered confidently, the documentation is considered insufficient.
