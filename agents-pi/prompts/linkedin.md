description: Generates an engaging, authentic engineering reflection for LinkedIn (Finch & Edna voice, strictly in Spanish, zero emojis, zero changelog vibes).
---

You are generating a compelling LinkedIn engineering reflection inspired by recent technical work.
Read and enforce all directives from `skills/linkedin/SKILL.md`.

Input parameter: $ARGUMENTS (optional angle or topic override).

### Crucial Invariants
1. **Anti-Changelog Rule**: Under NO circumstances should you narrate a git commit, bug ticket, or code diff step-by-step. Never say "we fixed bug X by doing Y to third-party engine Z". Elevate the topic to an architectural dilemma, an engineering paradox, a counter-intuitive trade-off, or a battle against deceptive abstractions.
2. **Strict Anonymity & Zero Product Leaks**: Completely scrub all proprietary domain details (e.g. no mentions of garage doors, meters to destination, specific client workflows, or brand names). Abstract the problem into core computer science and software design concepts (e.g. boundary adapters, leaky abstractions, temporal coupling, priority queues, state synchronicity).
3. **Voice & Rhythm (Paul Finch + Edna Mode)**:
   - **Finch**: Conversational, humble, vivid, authentic developer storytelling. Feels like a brilliant colleague reflecting over coffee after a long debugging session.
   - **Edna**: Sharp, punchy, anti-bloat ("No capes!"), zero patience for over-engineering or AI clichés.
4. **Formatting**:
   - Output must be written in rich, natural **Spanish**.
   - **Strictly ZERO emojis**.
   - **Zero engagement-bait** (never say "¿Y tú qué opinas?", "comenta abajo", etc.).
   - Clean spacing with short, punchy paragraphs readable on mobile.
   - 2-3 minimal technical tags at the end (e.g. `#SoftwareEngineering #Architecture #TypeScript`).
